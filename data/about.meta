Hi, I'm Nick!

I got started programming when I was 10 because I wanted to make games.
And while that passion is very much still alive, my interests have broadened and deepened.

## I'm not a spider so don't call me a web developer

A lot of my professional programming experience has been web-based.
This is, however, largely a function of what I have found work in and not what I truly enjoy doing.

I enjoy programming.

On one hand, the web is a necessary way to reach lots of users. But I am constantly dreaming of a day
when people are not encumbered by slow, buggy software. And countless experiences in a web browser are
of that sort.

Yes, there can be well-made websites, but there's still a limit to _how well_ you can actually make something
when you have all this crap between you and the user.

That's why, increasingly, I've become convinced that a good path forward is a solid cross-platform IMGUI layer.
