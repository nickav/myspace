For this project my goal was to make a prototype for a game in a week. I had _a lot_ of momentum coming off of that first week and kept exploring the concept for another month or so.
The main focus was on making a fun experience.

I took a lot of inspriation from ExOK games.

The first prototype used an image as the map for the world. Which has the cool property that you could visualize each map you loaded:

This got really unweildy after the first week. It was hard to pick unique colors for things.
I made a custom level editor for this which I was happy with how it played out.

In the end, I decided to stop pursuing the project because I didn't think there was enough of an interesting game here.
