Hello! This is my first post on my brand new website. This website was written from scratch in C using some libraries I've developed over the past year.
Please, take off your shoes and make yourself comfortable. I hope you enjoy your stay.

I want to share some thoughts on my journey so far and where I think I'm heading.
Maybe this will help you, or maybe not. Take everything I say with a grain of salt.

## The Beginning

I got started programming when I was 10 because I wanted to make games.
I remember playing Super Mario 64 on the Nintendo 64: my first game on my first console.
I thought to myself: "how does someone make this game?"
It was a simple thought in my 8 yo brain. But at the time, I couldn't even imagine what went on behind the scenes. The endearing polygon art was one hint. You could kind of tell that everything was made out of triangles.

I am happy to say that I can finally answer that question, but it's been a long journey.

I remember vidly when my friend told me about this program called Game Maker which allowed you to make games without any programming knowledge.

So I asked my dad for a computer, and he asked me "what do you want I computer for?". I told him I wanted to make and sell games on the internet.
He said "we can get you a computer, Nick.".
I am fortunate that my parents were able to get me a PC at the time.

My first computer was a Dell tower with a whopping 40Gb of memory.

I remember the first feeling of starting Game Maker staring at a blank white screen and being so excited to start making things.
I had no idea what I was doing.

I started learning how to make games by looking at tutorials and using these drag-and-drop blocks.
I would look at free examples people posted on the Game Maker Forums, ask questions when I got stuck.
It wasn't until a little later when I discovered that actually all of these blocks had one line of code you could type into this special block called a "Code Block".
I almost learned programming accidently.

## Freelancing 101

I got started freelancing in high school. My first gig was making a website for my dad's friends band.
I made a bunch of small websites for random people.

## First Job

My first programming job was at a local real-estate company.
I was working as an intern there building out various features on their website.
I learned a lot of things there: vim, git, tmux, bash.

## The Internship

I got an internship at CBSNews my freshman summer during college. I remember the exhausting 3 hour commute every day into NYC. I would pretty much get home and fall asleep, then wake up the next day and do it all over again.
Luckily this only lasted for 3 months and everyone I worked with was super nice.
But I hated commuting.

## LinkedIn Internship

I got an internship at LinkedIn during junior year summer.
This was my first time going out West.
I remember they said attire was "buisness casual" so I dressed like NYC business casual. And everyone wore jeans, t-shirts and even sandals.

It was a lot of fun, I instantly became great friends with my roommates, and we travelled all around California.
I really didn't enjoy the work all that much. I was working as an Android

## The Present

I really love this quote:

```

@quote
```
It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right with n independent random steps will, on the average, end up about sqrt(n) steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to n. In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, a career with a vision will get you a distance proportional to n, while no vision will get you only the distance sqrt(n). In a sense, the main difference between those who go far and those who do not is some people have a vision and the others do not and therefore can only react to the current events as they happen.

I am preaching the message that, with apparently only one life to live on this earth, you ought to try to make significant contributions to humanity rather than just get along through life comfortably — that the life of trying to achieve excellence in some area is in itself a worthy goal for your life. It has often been observed the true gain is in the struggle and not in the achievement — a life without a struggle on your part to make yourself excellent is hardly a life worth living. This, it must be observed, is an opinion and not a fact, but it is based on observing many people’s lives and speculating on their total happiness rather than the moment to moment pleasures they enjoyed. Again, this opinion of their happiness must be my own interpretation as no one can know another’s life. Many reports by people who have written about the “good life” agree with the above opinion. Notice I leave it to you to pick your goals of excellence, but claim only a life without such a goal is not really living but it is merely existing—in my opinion. In ancient Greece Socrates (469–399) said: The unexamined life is not worth living.

This resonates with me in a lot of ways.


## Gradient descent as a way to live

Following your immediate interests may lead you down weird rabbit holes, but it is possibly the only way forward.
Given your situation, what is the most interesting thing you could be working on.

Many people chase money, prestiege, .... But I want to work on things that are interesting to me.
Too much of web work is largely uninspiring.

Browsers are this incredible mess of complexity.
The speed of light is more like the speed of sound.

Well, this is to the new me.
To the me who commits to working on what's interesting, not what's profitable.
