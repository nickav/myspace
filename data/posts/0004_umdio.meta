An API for University of Maryland data.

I designed the documentation for this open-source project. I looked at other popular APIs for inspiration â€” mainly the StripeAPI, Android Developer Docs and Travis CI API.

I also designed the structure of the API itself, with the end-user (other developers) in mind. I used a RESTful-like structure as my base.
