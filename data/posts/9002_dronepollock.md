Created a Drone-powered Internet-of-Things Jackson Pollock splatter-painting where 200 people left their mark on a 15 ft canvas. Live-streamed to Technica, University of Marylandâ€™s all-ladies hackathon.

Drone flew autonomously with an overhead OpenCV tracking camera and a Node.JS controller. I helped Stef learn full-stack web dev. We built the website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Bash and Git.
