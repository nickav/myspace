Hello! This is my first post on my new website. This website was written from scratch in C using some libraries I've developed over the past year.
It's been a long journey and I'm hoping to use this space as a place to collect my thoughts and learnings.

Please, take off your shoes and make yourself comfortable. I hope you enjoy your stay.

I want to share some thoughts on my journey so far and where I think I'm heading.
