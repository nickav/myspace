One of the most common criticisms I hear is: "Why re-invent the wheel?"

Well, for starters there is no such thing as a wheel.
Also, if you truly want to learn about a thing, what better way that to write everything from scratch?

It's often said that writing helps you solidify your own understanding of a topic.
I think writing code is much the same.

At a high-level a game engine is just a glorified REPL.

A rough outline of things an engine needs to handle:

<ul>
<li>Setup</li>
<li>Assets</li>
<li>Input (Keyboard, Mouse, Controllers)</li>
<li>Output (Graphics, Audio)</li>
</ul>
